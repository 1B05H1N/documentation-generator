- Python 3 installed on your system.
- An OpenAI API key. You can obtain one by signing up on the OpenAI platform.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `documentation_generator.py` script.

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python documentation_generator.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to specify the type of document you want to create, provide specific details, and choose the desired format (Markdown or plain text).

5. The script will generate the documentation and present it to you.

6. You can choose to save the documentation as a Markdown file (with proper formatting) or plain text.

## Usage
